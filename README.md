## Repository Information  

### Git Flow  

We follow the **Git Flow** branching strategy, which allows parallel development and ensures a stable codebase at all times. The main branches we use are:  

- **Main** - For production-ready code.  
- **Develop** - For integration and testing.  
- **Feature** - For developing new features.  
- **Release** - For preparing production releases.  
- **Hotfix** - For urgent fixes to production.  

New features are branched off from `develop`, tested, and reviewed before being merged back into `develop`.  

---

### Naming Conventions  

Branch names follow these conventions:  

1. **Concise and Descriptive**  
   - Use clear names that reflect the purpose of the branch. Example: `feature/login`.  

2. **Lowercase and Hyphen-Separated**  
   - For long branch names, use hyphens for clarity. Example: `hotfix/server-crash`.
